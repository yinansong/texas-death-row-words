  "quotes": "Larry Ashworth in Fort Worth killed seven people. Take your message to the people. Yes sir, I charge the people of the jury. There was a lot of people that got me to this point, and I can't thank them all. We are all family, people of God Almighty. Father, I want to thank you for all of the beautiful people you put in my life. I guess the only thing I have to say about the Death Penalty is that a lot of times people think of it as one sided, but it’s not. March on black people. Keep marching black people. I could just ask for two greater people in their life now. Can you feel me people. To all people that supported me, you will always be in my heart, as I have always been in yours. I love ya'll, all of you people in there. Thank you to the people involved and to the courtesy of the officers. I hope people understand the grave injustice by the state. Life is about experience and people change. To my family and to you people, I can only apologize for all the pain I caused you. This is the part of the genocide, this is part of the African (unintelligible), that we as black people have endured in America. We must continue to stay strong all around the world, and people must come together to stop the systematic killing of poor and innocent black people. Only through you, Jesus Christ, people will see that you're still on the throne. I've hurt a lot of people. It is a blessing that there are people that they love so much but even more so, people that I love so much. I love the people, I love all of you for your blessing, strength, for your courage, for your dignity, the way you have come here tonight, and the way you have protested and kept this nation together. I know you people are here to find closure for the things that you have done or that I have done. After all these years my people are still lost in hatred and anger. To my family, to my friends, and people who have accepted me for being the person that I am. I hurt a lot of people with decisions I made. Lord, have mercy on these peoples' soul. There are two people still alive. For all of you people, I defended myself when I killed your family member. You won't be forgotten and there are a lot of people out there that love you. I have gained nothing, but just brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people. If there is any justice in this world, please use this to keep other people from being where I'm at. Especially for the people of the deceased, Sims is innocent and so am I. Life is about experience and people change. For all of you people, I defended myself when I killed your family member. It's not right to kill anybody just because I killed your people. A lot of people say I didn't commit those murders, I really did it. To be here on Texas death Row show all people that we people of American don't care about helping. I have gained nothing, but just brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people. I would like to thank Father Walsh for having become a Franciscan, and all the people all over the world who have become my friends. You know what these people are doing. There are 300 people on death row, and everyone is not a monster. Warden, this is murder just as surely as the people that killed Rebecca's mother. There were three people in the house and have confessed to it. Bless and protect all people. I want to let all of my people know and everybody who is here and supported me that I love them and wish them all the best. When officials of any state, such as the State of Texas, has so much confidence in their justice system, mistakes will be made, and innocent people will be executed. The people who work here, I thank them for the kindness they have shown me and I deeply appreciate all that has been done for me by the people who work here. Keep marching black people, black power. That means they got to have three people, the one that paid, the one that killed, and the deceased. You are magnificent people. I’ve got some people over here that believes that. There are people all over the world who face things worse than death on a daily basis, and in that sense I consider myself lucky. To all the people of Mexico, I would like to thank them for the help. To all the people that took the time to write a letter. Texas has executed innocent people, and tonight, Texas has shown just how broke and unfair its system is. Little people always seem to get squashed. Look after my people. Keep marching black people, black power. Give them peace God for people seeking revenge towards me. There are people on death row that need help. I know in my heart what I did and I call upon the spirit of my ancestors and all of my people and I swear to them and now I am coming home. I hope people understand the grave injustice by the state. A lot of people view what is happening here as evil, but I want you to know that I found love and compassion here. Young people, listen to your parents; always do what they tell you to do, go to school, learn from your mistakes. There are people that will be mad thinking I try to seek freedom from this, but as long as I see - freedom belongs to me and I'll keep on keeping on. Keep marching black people. Victory for the people will be assured. Because of what I caused to happen many people were affected and I am very sorry that I did. Well, I just wanted to ask people to pray for two families: my family and the family of Officer McCarthy. As I have said from the very first thing, I am innocent of this crime and God knows I am innocent and the four people that was murdered know I am innocent and when I get to heaven I'll be hunting you and we'll talk. I guess the first thing I want to do is thank some very special people, Sara and Sabrina. The people must avenge this murder. The people that did this - they know. Not because I am here, but because of what I did and I hurt a lot of people - you, and my family. The people responsible for killing me will have blood on their hands for an unprovoked murder. Let my people know I love them. You are great people. Life has not been that good to me, but I believe that now, after meeting so many people who support me in this, that all things will come to an end, and may this be fruit of better judgments for the future. Don’t let these people break (couldn’t understand) you. A lot of people have always asked if there is a Heaven, and I say there is. This is something these racist people will never do. Thank you, baby girl - love you people. There are 300 people on death row, and everyone is not a monster. I apologize for your loss and your pain, but I didn’t kill those people. I thank all of the people that have rallied to my cause. If you are going to demonstrate, I don't want you to do anything crazy to these people. I hope people out there will support them, listen to them and be there for them. God has to judge those people. The people will carry the revolution on. And for everybody else, those people who have malice in their heart, allow ambitions to over ride what they know. Man, there is a lot of people there. There pain on both sides and it’s not an issue that people just sit there and voice off and say, well, this is a good thing, or this is a bad thing. Couple of matters that I want to talk about since this is one of the few times people will listen to what I have to say. Ah, one of the few ways in the world the truth is ever going to get out, or people are ever going to know what's happening as long as we support a free press out there. I appreciate the people that helped me out. I, Ramiro Hernandez, say this with lots of love to young people, listen to your parents please. If my words can persuade you to discontinue this practice of executing people, please do so. We will continue to be strong as a people. I appreciate the people that helped me out, and uh, know that I love you, Angel and your family and all the people that helped me out. I never wanted to kill your family or these people. Because I leave behind alot of people that loved me, that believe I could had been that someone. Three people at different times confessed to killing these people - your parents. You people over there. I’ve got some people over here that believes that. Thank you for being there for me and all these people here will find the one who did this damn crime. I love all of the people who supported me all of these years. Father, I pray for these Wardens and the officers and the people that deal with all of this, Father, I ask that you touch their hearts, Father, and if there is any wrong to it, that you will forgive them, Father. It's not right to kill anybody just because I killed your people. I asked the Lord to have mercy on me and I hope He has mercy on these people carrying out this mass slaughter. Push forward people. Perhaps more important in a lot of ways is what we are doing to the environment is even more devastating because as long as we keep going the direction we're going the end result is it won't matter how we treat other people because everybody on the planet will be on their way out. Never, despite what other people say. You are great people. You are the people that must carry that revolutionary on, in order to liberate our children from this genocide and for what is happening here in America tonight. Well, first, My people, you guys have heard everything I needed to say today. Sanchez's family, I don't know who you are and other people present."

I hereby declare, Robert Steven Everett and Nicholas Velasquez, guilty of crimes against me, Douglas Alan Feldman. I guarantee you if I would have been there you would not be standing where you are if I would have been there. Even though I lay here I am still at peace. There are no words to describe the pain and suffering that you have gone through all these years, that is something that I cannot take back from you all.

There are 300 people on death row, and everyone is not a monster. I was in there right now thinking how we grew up. Could you please tell that lady right there, can I see her, she is not looking at me. To everybody back on the row, I know you're going through a lot over there. There was eight against me.

I understand that Michael Skains is supposed to be here somewhere. I was raised by the California Youth Authority, I can't really pin point where it started, what happened but really believe that's just the bottom line, what happened to me was in California. Everybody will be all right, because y'all are going where I am going. I would like to thank my family for their blessings and for sharing my struggle and having been there for me and endured this with me. Like I've said from day one, I did not go in there and kill them - but I am no better than those that did. Well here we are again folks, in the catacombs of justice. I'm sad that you are stuck here and have to go through all of this. It is neither here nor there. If there were any way I could change things and bring them back I would. The statement that I would like to make is, none of this should have happened and now that I'm dying, there is nothing left to worry about. If you will look at your house and the police report, there are several bullet patterns shot into the West wall over the bed and the East wall and North wall and your sister was in the front bedroom while 30 shots were fired. Back to my family, Thank yall for being here. There are 300 people on death row, and everyone is not a monster. Y'all know I love you and y'all know where we're at. You all brought me here to be executed, not to make a speech. You were given a job to do but that's neither here nor there. I know you people are here to find closure for the things that you have done or that I have done. Appreciate them being here to support me. I'll see you when you get there. I want to talk to my friends over here for a second. I want to talk to my friends over here for a second. I know how it feels, I've been there. There is nothing else I can say, that can help you. I’ve got some people over here that believes that. Thomas and I would like to invite all of those from the State and the family to be there if they would like to come. I have come here today to die, not make speeches. I worry more about you all because I know where I am going. I would totally be faking and believe me there is nothing fake about me. My family is not here present and that is by my wish and my wish only. There are two people still alive. Today, I realized that I can never say everything that needed to be said, because there is still so much that needs to be said. They have beat me up at the unit over there. I would like to tell the surviving victims here, society, my family and friends, that I ask that they forgive me for anything I have done. I will pray with this man down here and we will go: Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy name. There is not a day goes by that I have not prayed for Ronni Dawn Hewitt and Carol Dawson and her daughter who was left behind. I want to talk to you about being there by her.  There is a drawing that I forgot to tell you about, send it to Stacy. There are many things I would like to say, but none more important that how I feel toward Mr. And I hope you go beyond here and do what you need to do, do the right thing. See you when you get there. I hope you can find it in yourselves to forgive me and I hope all this here will kinda settle your pain and I hope the Lord will give you comfort and peace. That is where I am going. Now I lay here dead. where's my stunt double when you need one? Thanks for being there. I am going to heaven and I'll see you there. My Jesus my Savior there is none like you. I did have, but now I see my family here and everything - all I want to say is I love you all so much. Thank you for being here. There was no love showed to my aunt or none of my cousins. Be there for one another. We talk about a reprieve or stay from the Supreme Court, but the real Supreme Court you must face up there and not down here. You have been there for me through this whole thing. There is nothing I can say here or anything I could probably do. Neckbone, there's a sheet, I got your name on it. All of my brothers on death row, those who died and those who are still there, to hang in there. I understand where they're coming from, I thought every person was cruel. And make the public exposed to the genocide and this brutality world, and let the world see what is really happening here behind closed doors. I want the guys to know out there not to give up, not to give in, that I hope someday the madness in the system, something will come about, something will be resolved. I mean, I know y'all don't come down here. Now I want to thank all of you that came here today to be with me. There is no man that is free from all evil, nor any man that is so evil to be worth nothing. There is no closure without love. A lot of people have always asked if there is a Heaven, and I say there is. I hope people out there will support them, listen to them and be there for them. I will see you when you get there. I didn't know anybody was there. I will see y'all when you get there. I'd like to thank everybody that's been here through the years. There are people that will be mad thinking I try to seek freedom from this, but as long as I see - freedom belongs to me and I'll keep on keeping on. There is a point where a man wants to die in judgment. They are executing an innocent man because things did not happen as they say they happen and there's. (Spanish) Where are you Leo; are you there Leo? First of all, I want to say God bless everyone here today. Thank you for having been there for me -- and our Father and Mother. Look into yourself, thats where you'll find the fear you so desperately search for. I was in their reformatory schools and penitentiary, but ah they create monsters in there. The act I committed to put me here was not just heinous, it was senseless. You were out there with me, Tommy. Thank you for standing by me and being there for me. Today I’m going home to HEAVEN to live for all eternity with my HEAVENLY FATHER JESUS CHRIST, and as I lay here taking my last breath, I’ll be praying for all of you because you’re here today with anger and hatred in your hearts letting Satan deceive you into believing that what you’re doing is right and just. There is no excuse for what I did. Not because I am here, but for closure in your hearts. I pray on my own behalf for forgiveness for any and all of the pain I’ve caused you, I pray that some day you’ll realize your own mistakes and ask GOD to forgive you as I have, because there is no peace without GOD’s forgiveness. Tell her I came in here like a man and I will leave like a man. I walked in here like a man and I am leaving here like a man. Where's Mr. Lord forgive me for my sins because here I come. Jennifer, where are you at? I am going somewhere better. You are all here, the Robinson family is her to see me executed. I hope you have happiness from here on out. Thank you for being there. During my time here, I have been treated well by all T. I would like to thank all my loved ones that are standing over there for all the kindness and support you have shown me over the years. There is nothing strange, love governs all events, what is (unintelligible), who is who was his mother and father, we extend my love to all my brothers and sister extend to life and my religion, it is Allah. GOD help you, because what you’re doing here today and what’s in your hearts here today makes you no better than any man or woman on death-rows across this country. The victim's family is not here so I won't address them. To my family, I thank you and love you for being there for me and supporting me. There is no way for expressing I am sorry. I want Cindy to know that I know she is out there -- and Vicente Hernandez that I love them. To my family, I'll be there waiting for ya'll, alright? There were three people in the house and have confessed to it. The guys back there waiting, keep the faith and stay strong and put your faith in the Lord. I want those out there to keep fighting the death penalty. I'll see you when you get there, okay? You people over there."

There's more than 30 altered and falsified records saying I told so and so this or that, but you go look in their record, it does not say Thomas Mason called them at all and told them anything. I appreciate y'all being here and being strong for me, and Mama, you know I love you, and I appreciate all of these visits, the letters and everything y'all have done for me. Well, I don't have anything to say. I am sorry for everything that I have done. To Roger Burdge, I have nothing but love for all of you. I just ask everybody I ever hurt or done anything wrong to, to just forgive me for whatever wrongs I done to them. Just remember the good things and not the bad. Warden, Since I don't have nothing to say, you can go ahead and send me to my Heavenly Father. Same thing to all my pen friends and other friends, I love you all. My Lord is my life and savior, nothing shall I fear. I would like to say a little something. This doesn't solve anything. You have been there for me through this whole thing. For all the good things you have added to it. And to my family, and my loved ones - I am sorry for the pain for all those years and for putting you through all the things we had to go through. I am grateful for everything in my life. I think of tried everything I could to get in touch with ya'll to express how sorry I am. God, I want to say something so bad. Mom, this is nothing, I am going to go to sleep and wake up with Jesus. They've gotta do this thing. First off, to the Rosenbaum family, to Cindy, to Scott, to everyone, I just want to say I have nothing but love for you. I didn’t have anything to do with the stay. Anthony Graves had nothing to do with it. If I had to do again, I would not change a thing. We all know what really happened, but there are some things you just can’t fight. Everything is all right. Hopefully we will all learn something about ourselves and about each other and we will learn enough to stop the cycle of hate and vengeance and come to value what is really going on in this world. I know I wasn't going to say anything, but I've got to. I thank you for all the things you have done in my life, for the ways that you have opened my eyes, softened my heart. Nothing less. To the ones representing me today, thank you for everything. This is one time that I know I cannot show no remorse for something that I did not do. To Wes Clayton: You were nothing but a paid chump. It's not that I haven't been remorseful, things just never worked out before. I want everybody to know that I hold nothing against them. I want you to understand something, hold no animosity towards me. I am an innocent man, and something very wrong is taking place tonight. And I hope you go beyond here and do what you need to do, do the right thing. Thank you for everything. Please, that is something I need to know. I can't think of anything else. Be careful before you sign anything with your name. Everything is going to be okay. I ask that you not hold nothing against me or my family from this day forward, and hold no hate toward them. It's the right thing. And I want to thank you for everything you tried to do; it meant a lot to me. As I have said from the very first thing, I am innocent of this crime and God knows I am innocent and the four people that was murdered know I am innocent and when I get to heaven I'll be hunting you and we'll talk. Danny, something will pull us through."

  "quotes": "Tonight when I close my eyes, I'll be with my Father. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. Come home when you can. I will see you when you get there. Heavenly Father, as I come to you to praise and thank you that even now I can endure the pain that you endured when you died for me on the cross. Donna had her Christianity in tact when she died. By the time I came in, when I tried to help her, with first aid, it was too late. I'll see you when you get there, okay? A boy on Eastham doing a life sentence for killing Jamie Kent - I did not do it, but I was with his daddy when it was done. Mommy I will be home when I get there. Don't forget me and burn a candle for me when you can. I just wish just to be patient when the time for each and everyone of ya'll individually have ya'll time. First of all, I want you to understand I speak the truth when I say I didn’t kill your kids. I will be the first one you see when you cross over. Now all you all are seeing in the process a perfect example of ol’ freaky deaky Bill Clinton when he signed that anti-terrorism law to shorten the appeals. I will see y'all when you get there. But when they actually make facts up and present to the public as trial's evidence. You all have been there when no one else was. I'll see you when you get there. I'm mad for one reason, that I'm leaving you behind, when I am going to a better place. I'm not only saddened, but disappointed that a system that is supposed to protect and uphold what is just and right can be so much like me when I made the same shameful mistake. But when it comes out, I hope it stops this. I thank God that he died for my sins on the cross, and I thank Him for saving my soul, so I will know when my body lays back in the grave, my soul goes to be with the Lord. I am ready when you are. Chief Neal: as to what you said to me when you had me in the back seat of your car on the night of Nov 11? He has changed my life and I know that when I leave this body, I am going home to be with the Lord forever. where's my stunt double when you need one? She will tell you that when she gets a chance to. Whenever the state chooses to take a life and take the power of God into their own hands, whenever our leader's kill in the name of justice, we are all diminished. There's some guys I didn't get a chance to visit with, ah I met when I first drove up here…Lester Byers, Chris Black, Alba, John Alba, and Rosales Rock. Price of the mistake he made at Gene Hawthorn's trial when he said that Gene Hawthorn was telling the truth at my trial. I know you weren't happy when I stopped my appeals, but you know the reason why. I am to blame for this, I will take that Lord, when I get there. This is what happens to black men when they stand up and protest for what is right and just. I thank you for being kind to me when I was small. See you when you get there. For all of you people, I defended myself when I killed your family member. I’m not ready to go, but I have no choice; I sent several letters to my family; they’ll be very moving when you get them. I'll say when I see him I'm sorry. Specifically, I want to say that the bad evil man I was when I came to death row 13 years ago is no more – by the power of God; Jesus Christ; God Almighty; Holy Spirit, he has transformed me as a new creature of Christ. When I die, bury me deep, lay two speakers at my feet, put some headphones on my head and rock and roll me when I'm dead. My death began on August 2, 1991 and continued when I began to see the beautiful and innocent life that I had taken. I know you weren't happy when I stopped my appeals, but you know the reason why. I’m ready when ya’ll are. As I have said from the very first thing, I am innocent of this crime and God knows I am innocent and the four people that was murdered know I am innocent and when I get to heaven I'll be hunting you and we'll talk. You will answer to your Maker when God has found out that you executed an innocent man. I know when I die, I'll have life in heaven and life eternal everlasting. My family all knows the sincerity in my heart when I say these words to you. I was in the bathroom when he attacked. All I want to say is that when the state introduced my sister and my niece as state witnesses, it’s not that they testified against me. I wasn't the one who had the gun to give to police and all these altered records from the District Attorney's office and the Attorney General's office, that's why Michael Sputnick got fired and ran off when I filed these appeals. They used false testimony of a woman that said I had raped her, when the test showed that the foreign pubic hair that was found on her body belonged to no one in that room. The burden will be wiped away and you will be at ease to know that I know how it is and they will pay for it when their time comes. For all of you people, I defended myself when I killed your family member. where's my stunt double when you need one? We have so much to give when we give out of our hearts."

I would like to say to my family, I am alright. It's going to be alright. If it's alright, I just want to say a prayer first. To the Wright family, I pray for you, please find peace in your heart. It's not right to kill anybody just because I killed your people. If we confess our sins He is just and true to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. My last full statement is being released in a way other than me right here. First of all, you have every right to hate me and every right to want to see this. Everyone changes, right? All right, Warden. Everyone changes, right? And all I have to say is that right now I'm sorry that it happened and I was part, not part in it but, part responsible for not properly getting the word out in time to get the right victim or the right convict or the right person that did it. But get in church and get right with God. Continue the struggle for human rights, helping those who are innocent, especially Mr. All right, Warden. All right. It's going to be alright. I am alright. By them executing me ain't doing nothing right. Everybody will be all right, because y'all are going where I am going. I'm alright. It's alright Sean, it's alright. Alright, it's gong to be alright. I would like to say to my family, I am alright. And it's going to be alright. Make sure momma knows, alright. That's all right. Alright Warden. To my family, I'll be there waiting for ya'll, alright? Amen All right Warden, let's give them what they want. That I am praying right. If ya'll don't have your life right, get it right. But anyway I just wanted, right after that apologize to you. For almost nine years I have thought about the death penalty, whether it is right or wrong and I don't have any answers. It's not right to kill anybody just because I killed your people. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Y'all be strong now, alright? Be right. I hope that one day we can look back on the evil that we’re doing right now like the witches we burned at the stake. Charles, keep the right, now. I was in there right now thinking how we grew up. This what is happening right now is an injustice. As I look to my right and I see the family of Forest Hall. I am looking at her right now. It is the right thing to do. Alright. I see you there, you doing alright? All right Warden, I'm ready. Dear Lord, I ask You right now to be with each of the witnesses and lift them up and be on solid ground. Cori, thanks for everything, make sure my princess is all right. Give me my rights. Murder isn't right, killing of any kind isn't right. I can't be more sorry than I am right now. It's no big deal about choosing right from wrong. To the man to the right of me, I ask for forgiveness for you. Don't bury me to the left of dad, bury me on the right side of mom. I hope I said the right things. I'll be alright, don't worry. I can feel it right now. Yes, I would like to give love to my mother, sisters and brothers and let them know that I am thinking of them right now and I want to thank God for giving me such a loving family. Everything is all right. Bury me right beside momma. I, I never was right after that incident happened. It's the right thing. I'm alright. Give me my rights. Son, get your life right with Christ, also your mother. Alright. We refuse to compromise, we refuse to surrender the dignity for what we know is right. And know that what ya'll are doing is right. Today I’m going home to HEAVEN to live for all eternity with my HEAVENLY FATHER JESUS CHRIST, and as I lay here taking my last breath, I’ll be praying for all of you because you’re here today with anger and hatred in your hearts letting Satan deceive you into believing that what you’re doing is right and just. You have the right to see this, I am glad you are here. Give me my rights. Alright Warden. This is what happens to black men when they stand up and protest for what is right and just. He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Malcom X, Martin Luther King, and others who stood up for what was right. I'm not only saddened, but disappointed that a system that is supposed to protect and uphold what is just and right can be so much like me when I made the same shameful mistake. Thank you for all you have done and I want to make sure you are alright. All right, Warden, let's do it. And I hope you go beyond here and do what you need to do, do the right thing. I want to see you there, so get your heart right. Robin you know this ain't right. But someone is mad that a system that's supposed to protect and uphold what is just and right, has shown it's just as crooked as I am said to be. Nothing more than state sanctioned murders, state sanctioned lynching, right here in America, and right here tonight. I died fighting for what was just and what was right. He restoreth my soul; He guides me down the right paths."

If I knew who killed Rosalyn I would let you know, but, I am going to say this: I am going to heaven with God as my witness. I know it won't bring her back. I know you believe that you’re going to have closure tonight and as I stand before God today, the true judge, I had nothing to do with the death of your family. I know it is hard for you all. I can feel it now. There is no way that I can know your pain and sorrow for losing someone so close to you.

I was in there right now thinking how we grew up. Son be strong no matter what happens, know that God is looking over you. Life has not been that good to me, but I believe that now, after meeting so many people who support me in this, that all things will come to an end, and may this be fruit of better judgments for the future. You know it. I know I have affected them for so long. I'm sorry I couldn't talk with you before all of this, but you know me. I know it is a great loss and I want to apologize. You all know what I've gone through. That was a very unfortunate incident and only God knows why it was an unintentional situation that took place. We know it's not true. I always wanted to tell you but I just didn't know how. We know the lies they told in court. I know that is not going to eliminate the pain, because I have a child. I just want everybody to know I didn't walk to this. I would like to thank my lawyer, Nancy, for her help on my case and for being with me now. And to my family, know that I love every single one of you and pray that God gives you peace and strength. Just know that I'll be watching over you. So for the life for which I live now in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. I know it was a mistake. So, I call on to all of my brothers and sisters and to members of the human race that still have some knowledge for what love divine love is. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.

Everybody has their time, don't worry about me. You showed me a love that I sometimes didn't deserve. We know that you are Allah, that you are the prophet in these days that is in charge of the human race in this new era of time. Hate causes a lifetime of pain. That's it and it's time to roll up out of her. I hope sometime in the future you can forgive me. You know that you have my heart, I've enjoyed these times. I’m regretful for what I done, but I’m a different person from that time. I have no hard feelings toward anyone cause the Lord feels that it is my time to come home to Him, my work on earth is done and that, ah, like I said, I am just sorry for, but they will have to go through this one time again, cause sooner or later, whoever did this crime is going to be caught and they'll have to come down here and do this again and they will realize they witnessed an innocent man going to be with Jesus Christ. At the same time I bear witness there is no God but Allah and the Prophet Mohammad. My time is up. Yes, I do, uh at this time I would like to thank my parents who have been my pillar of strength throughout this. I've done wrong, sure, I've paid the time. At time I can come. I appreciate all the good and bad times together. I want you to be strong and get through this time. It didn't come out in time to save my life. Its time for a moratorium in the State of Texas. I would like to take this time to, ah, to use this moment an example for Christ. Taking the time to show me the friendship that you did. During my time here, I have been treated well by all T. You have given me more hope then I have had in a long time. As of that time, the State of Texas has been holding me illegally in confinement and by force for 15 years. By the time I came in, when I tried to help her, with first aid, it was too late. Sometimes you don't know what to say; I hope these words give you comfort. When the time comes. It would take me an hour or a long time, man, but, ah, man, I don't want to hold y'all up, man, like that, ah. The burden will be wiped away and you will be at ease to know that I know how it is and they will pay for it when their time comes. Some time ago I got a letter, I read it, and stuck it in with a bunch of stuff; and I thought to myself, what a cold-hearted person. I have regretted this for a long time. To the Christian hip-hop community, all the positive brothers I've done time with. I have had time to understand the pain I have caused you. But during your time of departure from this earth plane you will have to face the judgement of God for the lack of love you have shown my aunt and my cousins. I would like to say before I go that it has been said that I have shown no remorse, but if you look at my record and my background, ask anybody that know me that in order for me to show any kind of remorse for killing that ever been done, this one time I can't show no remorse for something that I did not do and if I did I would be faking. I will be with you every time you take a shower. In other words, Officer Boswell was angry at the time I walked up. I apologize and I know that you may not be able to forgive me and I know that may not be able to forgive me in this life and in this world, but I hope sometime in the future you will be able to find it in you to forgive me. The best time in my life is during this period. This is one time that I know I cannot show no remorse for something that I did not do. You know, once upon a time diamonds were priceless. These two (unintelligible) to the masters of the temple of the son we have been honored to dwell in our father's house at least for the time in which this finite time has come to it's assigned time for one. To all the people that took the time to write a letter. Heavenly Father, I give thanks for this time, for the time that we have been together, the fellowship in your world, the Christian family presented to me (He called the names of the personal witnesses. I have had time to get ready, to tell my family goodbye, to get my life where it needed to be. I just ask and hope that sometime down the line that you can forgive me. This was the only way God could save me; I would pay it back a thousand times to bring back your loved ones. And all I have to say is that right now I'm sorry that it happened and I was part, not part in it but, part responsible for not properly getting the word out in time to get the right victim or the right convict or the right person that did it. Since I have already said all I need to say to all my loved ones, I'm not going to say anything to y'all at this time. And I want to thank the media for being nice to me all this time. Well Mom, sometimes it works out like this. Many times in life we take the wrong road and there are consequences for everything. Couple of matters that I want to talk about since this is one of the few times people will listen to what I have to say. I wanted to prepare a longer statement but time ran out. I guess the only thing I have to say about the Death Penalty is that a lot of times people think of it as one sided, but it’s not. He needs to be stopped or he is going to do it time and time again. If I been given a real chance in life instead of denial or incarceration everytime I was arrested for something the community believed I did. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Lord Jesus, thank you for giving me the strength and the time in my life to find Jesus Christ and to be forgiven for all of my sins. Father, God, I just thank you for the time that you have given me on this earth, for having mercy on somebody like me for all the despicable thing's I've done in my life, Father, but you still with your love and your mercy reach down into my heart and changed it before it's too late. I’m regretful for what I done, but I’m a different person from that time."

Only God will determine if I am truly guilty or innocent of being the type of person I have been drawn up to be by the press and media. They did everything but make sure I got a fair trial to prove I was innocent. They know I'm innocent. I'm an innocent man. To the State of Texas, I am an innocent man. I have no hard feelings toward anyone cause the Lord feels that it is my time to come home to Him, my work on earth is done and that, ah, like I said, I am just sorry for, but they will have to go through this one time again, cause sooner or later, whoever did this crime is going to be caught and they'll have to come down here and do this again and they will realize they witnessed an innocent man going to be with Jesus Christ. Linda is innocent of this. They are executing an innocent man because things did not happen as they say they happen and there's. You are pursuing the execution of an innocent man. I'm innocent. We must continue to stay strong all around the world, and people must come together to stop the systematic killing of poor and innocent black people. Ya'll are killing an innocent man. You will answer to your Maker when God has found out that you executed an innocent man. They are not doing anything to change the world, but they are harming innocent children. They may execute me but they can't punish me because they can't execute an innocent man. I am innocent, innocent, innocent. Especially for the people of the deceased, Sims is innocent and so am I. Texas has executed innocent people, and tonight, Texas has shown just how broke and unfair its system is. My death began on August 2, 1991 and continued when I began to see the beautiful and innocent life that I had taken. They know I'm innocent. I am innocent. As I have said from the very first thing, I am innocent of this crime and God knows I am innocent and the four people that was murdered know I am innocent and when I get to heaven I'll be hunting you and we'll talk. I still proclaim I am innocent, and that’s all I have to say. Lord reach down and help innocent men on death row. I am innocent. At some point the government has got to wake up and stop doing things to destroy other countries and killing innocent children. Find one who needs help and make a small sacrifice of your own wealth and save the innocent ones. You're gonna stop killing innocent kids, murdering young kids. All I want to say is I'm innocent, I didn't kill my wife. Sharon Wilson, y'all convicted an innocent man and you know it. I charge each and every one of you with the murder of an innocent man. The only statement I want to make is that I am an innocent man - convicted of a crime I did not commit. I just want to say two thing, executing someone that is innocent, cause even though I am."

When you look at the video, you know you can't see anyone. You overplayed your hand looking for something against me and to cover it up the State is killing me. Approximately 28 years ago, I remember looking down at a bassinet, I saw an angel. We are filled with love looking for affection and a way to understand. I was sick, afraid, and looking for love in all the wrong ways. If you will look at your house and the police report, there are several bullet patterns shot into the West wall over the bed and the East wall and North wall and your sister was in the front bedroom while 30 shots were fired. You look after each other. To the West family, I hope you find in your hearts forgiveness and peace, and find the strength to move forward and the closure they are looking for. I would like to say before I go that it has been said that I have shown no remorse, but if you look at my record and my background, ask anybody that know me that in order for me to show any kind of remorse for killing that ever been done, this one time I can't show no remorse for something that I did not do and if I did I would be faking. If you look at the transcripts, I didn't kill Mr. I am ashamed to even look at your faces. I was asked about the letter, I spent half the night looking for the letter.

  "quotes": "May God forgive us on this day. I hope you can find peace in the days to come. It’s a good day to die. Today is the day I’ll be set free from all this pain and suffering. We must, you must brothers, that's why I have called you today. After today, I hope you can go on. Over the last few days we've had a chance to say it all. Today, I realized that I can never say everything that needed to be said, because there is still so much that needs to be said. And to my family I would also like to extend to them the same apology for the pain and misery that I have put them through, and I love them dearly from the bottom of my heart, and one day I would like to see them on the other side. I pray on my own behalf for forgiveness for any and all of the pain I’ve caused you, I pray that some day you’ll realize your own mistakes and ask GOD to forgive you as I have, because there is no peace without GOD’s forgiveness. Someday I will see you there. One of these days I'm going to return and get that for myself. The next day I received a letter that they had lost a friend to suicide. Rebecca, I understand that you wanted this day to come, you got what you wanted. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sin as we forgive our debtors. Well, first, My people, you guys have heard everything I needed to say today. Today you are a witness, the state. Today I have come to realize that for peace and happiness, one has to do things God's way. I hope that someday you can find peace. All of my days I want to praise, let every breath. To the ones representing me today, thank you for everything. Give us this day our daily bread. Please, I ask that you not let me down and that I will be with you today in Heaven. Today I go home to the Lord. I hope one day you can find peace. Father, we are all here today for the mistake that I have made and I thank you for your mercy for sending your Son into this life, that we might come to know you, Father. If I lie here today where I lie, I can say in the face of death, Jesus is Lord. Give us this day our daily bread. The truth will come out someday. I ask for your protection and my salvation, my night and my day. Now I want to thank all of you that came here today to be with me. I ask that you not hold nothing against me or my family from this day forward, and hold no hate toward them. They got these numbers that I called today. I apologize for taking the life of your daughter and I know how much pain you must be in because I saw my family today. Yes, you know I sat in my cell many days wondering what my last words would be: love for my family, grandson, friends. I prayed for ya'll every day and every night. All of my days I want to praise, let every breath. I thank the Lord for the man I am today. Do what I told you and you will see me one day. I just want to say I am not sad today or bitter with anybody. I've noticed that in the last couple of days. This is a great day to approach this glorious event. I pray one day we will all meet in heaven. To my family and friends, I love you and some day we will all be together again. I hope that Megan, if she is here present today, know that today I hope you get peace and joy. I hope that someday you can find peace. I know most of you are here to see me suffer and die but you’re in for a big disappointment because today is a day of joy. I can give you one thing, and I'm going to give that today. And the alleged remunerator is out on the streets, so how come I’m being executed today, without a remunerator? I would like to give thanks to God Almighty, by whose grace I am saved through His son, Jesus Christ, without whom I would be nothing today. Today I get mine. Give this day your daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Someday I will see you there. I am sorry for the pain all of them have gone through during holidays and birthdays. Not one day has passed that I wish I could take it back. I hope that someday this absurdity that humanity has come to will come to and an end. I just pray that some day you will find forgiveness in your heart. Today is a good day for dying. We all have to stand before God at the end of the day. Frank: I am sorry brother for what happened to your sister and I hope that you would forgive me one day. GOD help you, because what you’re doing here today and what’s in your hearts here today makes you no better than any man or woman on death-rows across this country. May you continue in the struggle and may you change all that's being done here today and in the past. To the guys on death row, stay strong and I hope to see you someday. This person shoe did that 10 years ago isn't the same person you see today. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever. I'll see you in Heaven someday. This is a great day to pass on. I wanted to wait for a thirty day stay for a DNA test so you know who did the crime. I am truly sorry, and there is not a day that I have not prayed for you. I would like to say a final prayer: Dear Heavenly Father, I come to you today, Lord, and thank You for this opportunity to be with You in paradise. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our tresspasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Like I've said from day one, I did not go in there and kill them - but I am no better than those that did. One day, I hope you will. Only the sky and the green grass goes on forever and today is a good day to die. To my family and friends, father, sister and brother, those that have traveled so far to be here today, please just know that I am at peace. To Kathy’s family and friends that were unable to attend today, I am truly sorry. Sister Dorothy, and my brother Tomas and we know that our father Allah will bless them in the following days to come. There is not a day goes by that I have not prayed for Ronni Dawn Hewitt and Carol Dawson and her daughter who was left behind. Thank you for being here today to honor Falicia Prechtl, whom I didn't even know. I would like to say to the family, I regret the pain I've put you through and I hope you can get over it someday. Remember that today I’ll be with Jesus in paradise. First of all, I want to say God bless everyone here today. Ah, you have been a blessing to me and I love you all and one day I will see y'all, so I hope y'all find y'all peace, comfort, and strength in Christ Jesus alone, because that's where it's at. I want to say I am sorry and I say a prayer today for you so you can have peace and I hope that you can forgive me. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. I hope that one day we can look back on the evil that we’re doing right now like the witches we burned at the stake. I will see ya'll one of these days. We know that you are Allah, that you are the prophet in these days that is in charge of the human race in this new era of time. All I ask is that I have one day and all the memories of you and my family and all the things that have happened. I wish that someday you could come to terms and understand. One day I hope you can move on and if not I understand. I know you believe that you’re going to have closure tonight and as I stand before God today, the true judge, I had nothing to do with the death of your family. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us. I just hope that all of you can understand that and someday forgive me. Though my judgment is merciful, I hope and pray that all those involved as well as the judgment upon ya’ll, will one day be more merciful than mine. Today, this does not bring you peace because this is not really the way. I got reason to rejoice and I pray to see all of you there someday. If you had wanted to punish me you would have killed me the day after, instead of killing me now. Today I have victory in Christ and I thank Jesus for taking my spirit into His precious hands. Today I’m going home to HEAVEN to live for all eternity with my HEAVENLY FATHER JESUS CHRIST, and as I lay here taking my last breath, I’ll be praying for all of you because you’re here today with anger and hatred in your hearts letting Satan deceive you into believing that what you’re doing is right and just. I’ve been praying all day for Carl Levin’s wife to drive the bitterness from her heart because that bitterness that’s in her heart will send her to Hell just as surely as any other sin. I want the guys to know out there not to give up, not to give in, that I hope someday the madness in the system, something will come about, something will be resolved. I have come here today to die, not make speeches. Today you’re committing murder too!"

And make the public exposed to the genocide and this brutality world, and let the world see what is really happening here behind closed doors. Ah, one of the few ways in the world the truth is ever going to get out, or people are ever going to know what's happening as long as we support a free press out there.

I want the world to know that I’m innocent and that I’ve found peace. I apologize and I know that you may not be able to forgive me and I know that may not be able to forgive me in this life and in this world, but I hope sometime in the future you will be able to find it in you to forgive me. If there is any justice in this world, please use this to keep other people from being where I'm at. He was mad at the world. I had the best brothers and sisters in the world. They are not doing anything to change the world, but they are harming innocent children. They are the key for making the world a better place."

  "quotes": "To all the people that took the time to write a letter. But that's okay. Approximately 28 years ago, I remember looking down at a bassinet, I saw an angel. Look after your sister for me. Her kids had asthma and I lent her the book. I'll see you on the other side, okay. I have said in interviews, if you want to hurt me and choke me, that's how terrible I felt before this crime. I'm really ok. The reason it took them so long is because they couldn't find a vein. I want to thank the prosecutor in my case; it took courage for him to do what he did but he did what he did because he believed in the judicial system. As I look to my right and I see the family of Forest Hall. If you look at the transcripts you will see. When you look at the video, you know you can't see anyone. I'm so sorry that all of this took place. The people responsible for killing me will have blood on their hands for an unprovoked murder. I would like to say before I go that it has been said that I have shown no remorse, but if you look at my record and my background, ask anybody that know me that in order for me to show any kind of remorse for killing that ever been done, this one time I can't show no remorse for something that I did not do and if I did I would be faking. I'll be looking for you. I am looking at you Mr. And you all look after Aleda and make sure she is a part of this family. I have tried to do something to compensate the families by writing a book. That's the biggest joke, I deserve this. You overplayed your hand looking for something against me and to cover it up the State is killing me. I would like to give thanks for the unjust way my trial attorneys John Donahue and Frank Hollbrook purposely denied me a fair trial. I know you can't accept my apology, I know you can't give your forgiveness; it's okay and I understand. The Death Penalty in Texas is broke. I took a father, it wasn't my fault, it was an accident. I am here because I took a life and killing is wrong by an individual and by the state, and I am sorry we are here but if my death gives you peace and closure then this is all worthwhile. I mean ah, I don't want y'all to look at me like I am a killer or something man, cause I ain't no killer. Look into yourself, thats where you'll find the fear you so desperately search for. Look after my people. I was asked about the letter, I spent half the night looking for the letter. Secondly, I am ok. Collins family, I know your not going to get the closure you are looking for tonight. I spoke to Ms. I took his life for the love of a friend. I am ashamed to even look at your faces. I mean, I know how it look, but I didn't do it. That was a very unfortunate incident and only God knows why it was an unintentional situation that took place. To the West family, I hope you find in your hearts forgiveness and peace, and find the strength to move forward and the closure they are looking for. Look out for each other. I invoke Your name. I was sick, afraid, and looking for love in all the wrong ways. Look at my life and learn from it. I look into my family's eyes, and I see sadness. I took a polygraph and passed. You were looking for me yourself and would have taken care of me yourself. Donna Vick helped me; she took me off the street. I took family member's life and I shouldn't have. I am sorry for the life I took from you. You broke the law. I hope that one day we can look back on the evil that we’re doing right now like the witches we burned at the stake. What is happening here is an outrage for any civilized country to anybody anywhere to look at what's happening here is wrong. I leave this life with a clear conscience and heart; I can say that only because I have spoke the truth over the last 16+ years. Look after Mary Lynn for me. But someone is mad that a system that's supposed to protect and uphold what is just and right, has shown it's just as crooked as I am said to be. We are filled with love looking for affection and a way to understand. John Gomez said Veronica does not have the money for your book so don't come over. You all have some very serious look on your face and something very serious fixin' to happen now. I just want to say I don't want you to have hate in your heart for me, because I took your loved one. I pray that everyone involved overlooks the stupidity. I hope you don’t look for satisfaction or comfort or peace in my execution. Tell my babies daddy will look down on them. Everything is ok. If you will look at your house and the police report, there are several bullet patterns shot into the West wall over the bed and the East wall and North wall and your sister was in the front bedroom while 30 shots were fired. I'm ok. Hey, don't y'all worry about me, okay? Texas has executed innocent people, and tonight, Texas has shown just how broke and unfair its system is. What is happening to me now is unjust and the system is broken. But it’s something that’s, you know, needs to be looked at and desired in each heart. Everything is going to be okay. Son be strong no matter what happens, know that God is looking over you. There's more than 30 altered and falsified records saying I told so and so this or that, but you go look in their record, it does not say Thomas Mason called them at all and told them anything. I am ashamed to even look at your faces. I did wrong, now I am paying the ultimate price, even though it's a crooked way. If you look at the transcripts, I didn't kill Mr. I'll see you when you get there, okay? Veronica told me to come and get my herb book and she went to the back of the closet. He spoke to his family and said he would carry their love with him. And the other joke is I am not Patrick Bryan Knight, and ya'll can't stop this execution now. I know I took someone very precious to you. I said I was going to tell a joke. I am looking at her right now. Uh, look at this as a learning experience. Y'all take and y'all look after Sheila and Shannon and them, call 'em and get the pictures to 'em and everything and, ah, again, like I said, I feel sorry for the families, but if it takes my death to make them happy, then I will bless them. We can’t look back. I made lots of mistakes that took your son. Look after Mary Lynn for me. Could you please tell that lady right there, can I see her, she is not looking at me. You look after each other. I am going to look for you."

Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. I invoke Your name. He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righeousness for his name's sake. Whenever the state chooses to take a life and take the power of God into their own hands, whenever our leader's kill in the name of justice, we are all diminished. I just thank you and in Jesus' name, I pray, Amen."

  "quotes": "The truth will come out someday. First of all, I want you to understand I speak the truth when I say I didn’t kill your kids. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. God knows the truth. Now, my statement to the world: I am in the midst of truth. I wish you could have seen the videotape at the end of trial, so you could know the truth. I leave this life with a clear conscience and heart; I can say that only because I have spoke the truth over the last 16+ years. The truth is that you are going to feel empty after tonight. I wish you could get the rage from your hearts and you could see the truth and get rid of the hatred. I am trying to tell you the truth. Get the transcripts, let the truth come out so that I do not die in vain. The truth has always been there. We know the truth. I know it doesn't mean anything; I told the truth because I feel like you should know who killed your loved one. I told the Judge the truth it was an accident. Thank you for being so determined to only seek a specific conclusion, truth be damned! To everybody else, the truth will be known. He'll tell you the truth about what happened to your husband. I am the only one that can say that truthfully. My truth will always be my truth. It's bad enough that a prosecutor can take truth and spin on it and try to re-doctor it. Price of the mistake he made at Gene Hawthorn's trial when he said that Gene Hawthorn was telling the truth at my trial. We know the truth and I know it. If you want to know the truth, and you deserve to know the truth, hire your own investigators. Ah, one of the few ways in the world the truth is ever going to get out, or people are ever going to know what's happening as long as we support a free press out there. I did not kill Bobby Lambert, and the truth is going to come out. And to the family, the truth will come out and I hope you find peace."

Darling Kerstin, these last few years have been blessed having you in my life. Now I have devastated my family as well, but my heart has grown in the last few minutes because I was forgiven by the family of Mr. My last statement. Yes, you know I sat in my cell many days wondering what my last words would be: love for my family, grandson, friends. The only thing I want to say is that I appreciate the hospitality that you guys have shown me and the respect; and the last meal was really good. Today I’m going home to HEAVEN to live for all eternity with my HEAVENLY FATHER JESUS CHRIST, and as I lay here taking my last breath, I’ll be praying for all of you because you’re here today with anger and hatred in your hearts letting Satan deceive you into believing that what you’re doing is right and just. I told your sister my last words. To Audrey's grandmother, I am sorry for the pain I have caused you for the last 15 years and your family. My last full statement is being released in a way other than me right here. I spent the last twenty years waiting to figure out what’s going on. The last two years have been the best. I have no last words. I have been sorry for the last 10 years for what I did. I would gladly trade the last 24 years if it would bring back Mark Fredericks. Hello to all: Tonight I take my last walk as well breath in this world called Earth. I am glad it didn't last long. I would like to thank all of the men on Death Row who have showed me love throughout the years, but especially the last two or three weeks, and I hold nothing against no man. What has happened for the last 100 or so years in America. But the person that had the gun, they know was not Thomas Mason, so who's getting the last laugh after all? Over the last few days we've had a chance to say it all. I know when I die, I'll have life in heaven and life eternal everlasting. I spent the last twenty years waiting to figure out what’s going on. My last words will be: And He was the light that shineth in the hearts of all man from the foundations of the world. I've noticed that in the last couple of days. I'll be seeing you, this is my last breath."

  "quotes": "This execution is one of those wrongs yet doesn’t mean our whole system of justice is wrong. Many times in life we take the wrong road and there are consequences for everything. Bryant, I have wronged you and your family and for that I am truly sorry. I know I am wrong but I am asking ya'll to forgive me. I did wrong, now I am paying the ultimate price, even though it's a crooked way. I was sick, afraid, and looking for love in all the wrong ways. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. I've done wrong, sure, I've paid the time. For almost nine years I have thought about the death penalty, whether it is right or wrong and I don't have any answers. I just wanted you to know that I wronged your family. It was wrong what I did. It's no big deal about choosing right from wrong. It is wrong to put the families through this. I asked my family to contact you, because they did no wrong. That letter she wrote wasn't wrong, she was just hurting. I forgive everyone for this process, which seems to be wrong. I was wrongfully convicted of this crime against Michael Watkins and James Williams on 10th Street on August 31, 1993. I am here because I took a life and killing is wrong by an individual and by the state, and I am sorry we are here but if my death gives you peace and closure then this is all worthwhile. Dell you tell the rest of them what they did was wrong for letting me fall for what they did. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I am an innocent man, and something very wrong is taking place tonight. What happened was wrong. Father, I pray for these Wardens and the officers and the people that deal with all of this, Father, I ask that you touch their hearts, Father, and if there is any wrong to it, that you will forgive them, Father. I just ask everybody I ever hurt or done anything wrong to, to just forgive me for whatever wrongs I done to them. What is about to transpire in a few moments is wrong! What is happening here is an outrage for any civilized country to anybody anywhere to look at what's happening here is wrong. I have no grudges against anyone, or any of the things that have gone wrong. I know I was wrong; I accept responsibility as a man. It is wrong for the prosecutors to lie and make witnesses say what they need them to say. Mom, you didn't do anything wrong."

Don't ever think you're perfect, none of us are perfect. Don't ever hate them for what they do. Perhaps more important in a lot of ways is what we are doing to the environment is even more devastating because as long as we keep going the direction we're going the end result is it won't matter how we treat other people because everybody on the planet will be on their way out. I just ask everybody I ever hurt or done anything wrong to, to just forgive me for whatever wrongs I done to them. I may not be with you in the physical, but by grace, my heart will be with you all and I know God loves every one of you all. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Give everybody my love. I've never been more proud of anybody than I have of my daughter and my son. Thanks for everything. I have made my peace with God and I pray that soon everyone will be able to have closure in their hearts and lives. To Melanie, I never meant to hurt you. To everybody back on the row, I know you're going through a lot over there. They did everything but make sure I got a fair trial to prove I was innocent. Donna gave me everything I could ask for. I hope everybody I’ve done anything to will forgive me. Tom Crouch, and everybody, I love you. There are 300 people on death row, and everyone is not a monster. Thank you for everything. Gray and everyone that I didn't do what I did to hurt you all. I hope that everyone gets some closure from this. Tell everybody I said hi and that I love them and I will see them on the other side. I was there with him and down through the years there were several more that I had done or had a part of. Take care, give everybody my regards. I never knew I could do it, but you made it possible. I just want to let everyone know that this here is a tragedy. And I want everyone to know I did not walk to this because this is straight up murder. My bad - everybody is here because of what happened. I'd like to thank everybody that's been here through the years. I got convicted on a false confession because I never admitted to it, but my lawyer did not put this out to the jury. Um, Cathy you know I never meant to hurt you. I would like to say before I go that it has been said that I have shown no remorse, but if you look at my record and my background, ask anybody that know me that in order for me to show any kind of remorse for killing that ever been done, this one time I can't show no remorse for something that I did not do and if I did I would be faking. I would just like to address to the media with everybody's permission. And to my family, know that I love every single one of you and pray that God gives you peace and strength. Love never fails. I want to thank everybody around the world and Father, let your will be done. I'll always remember you, and love you forever. I thank you for all of the beautiful promises that you make us in your word, and I graciously received every one of them. I love each and every one of you and hope you can find forgiveness for me. I am ready Warden, I am sorry everybody, I did it. I'm talking to each and every soul in this building, in this room. God bless everybody. And all of these it was never nothing personal. I am not crying for myself, I am crying for the lost and those that are dying for their sins, those that are committing suicide, those that don't know God and have never been set free. My only statement is that no cases have ever tried have been error free. Cori, thanks for everything, make sure my princess is all right. I gave you everything and that's what made me so angry. I think of tried everything I could to get in touch with ya'll to express how sorry I am. There's overwhelming and compelling evidence of my defense that has never been heard in any court of America. Never trust a court-appointed attorney. I would never have understood that without you. Let everybody know I love them. I love you momma, and Misty and Annette, Brenda and Anthony - and all my friends and everybody that supported me. I thank everyone for supporting me. The road goes on forever, and the party never ends. My bad - everybody is here because of what happened. OK To everybody on both sides of that wall--I want you to know I love you. This is not the end, but the beginning of a new chapter for you and I together forever. I want her to know that every thing that is said, every move that is made, every motion, I hold it true to my heart. I can never find the words to express my love for all of you. I never meant for them to be taken. I love each and every one of you. I never knew until I ran across my own. And for everybody else, those people who have malice in their heart, allow ambitions to over ride what they know. Let everyone know that I love them; this is not goodbye. I love everyone that loves me. I do, I would like to tell everybody that I'm sorry about the situation that happened. Never harbor hate. I love you too Shay I love you if your listening I am sorry to be putting everybody through this. I am sorry, it is her innocence and her life which began the remorse every since December 1, 1991. I want to tell everyone, my family, thanks for standing by me. God watches everything. To my family, my soul beloved, you’re so beautiful, for all your love and support is just miraculous, everything that ya’ll have done."

I'm mad for one reason, that I'm leaving you behind, when I am going to a better place. Do not give up the fight; do not give up hope for a better future.
